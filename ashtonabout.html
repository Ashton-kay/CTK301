        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Ashton is currently a student at Illinois State University, double majoring in Creative Technology-Video Game Design and Set Design/Production. The fine arts have been an important part of Ashton’s life and continues to be a strong influence in her life. Over the years she has taken many art classes and voice lessons, along with being involved in the theatre. From a young age, Ashton wanted to be either involved in theatre or the creation of video games. Unable to decide on which to major in, she decided to major in both Creative Technology and Set Design/Production.</p>

        <p>Ashton’s portfolio continues to grow with a handful of different projects from both her Creative Technology classes and her Set Design/Production classes. Once she graduates, Ashton would like to continue her studies and go to graduate school and receive her Masters. The future is filled with opportunities and Ashton is ready to chase after them all.</p>
