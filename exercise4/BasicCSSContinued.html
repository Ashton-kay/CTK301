    <p class="textright">In March of 2020, the world stopped as the deadly virus, COVID-19, spread across the world like wildfire. One by one, countries started to close their borders a declare a nationwide quarantine in hope to slow down the virus but to no avail. This was not the first pandemic that left a trail of deceased in its wake and it certainly will not be the last. With all the evidence of a possible pandemic pilling up, why was the world not prepared to face the virus? People have the mentality that in their lifetime, they will not live through an epidemic or even a pandemic, therefore, thinking that they have no need to be prepared for the inevitable. By the time these people are faced with reality that the pandemic is real and very deadly, it will be too late to formulate a plan. Today, everyone has personally been affected by COVID-19 in some shape or form. So many people have lost loved ones to the virus and so many more are testing positive every single day.</p>

    <p class="textleft">Shown in the movie Contagion, three major factors help fuel the fatal virus, MEV-1, turning it into a fatal pandemic almost overnight. During the industrial revolution, urbanization increased across nations as more jobs became available in large cites as factories started to develop. Like a moth to a flame, people in rural areas flocked to the already bustling cities to work for the factories. To help support the overpopulation, housing complexes would lodge multiple families into tiny living quarter, creating the perfect breeding ground for bacteria and viruses. It became easy to transmit diseases due to the proximity between household members. From there the household members would then spread the diseases to neighbors, friends, co-workers, and other people allowing the disease to circulate throughout the city. After 260 years, urbanization is still a major component to the spread to diseases across the nation.</p>

    <p class="textcenter">Globalization has helped unite the world, but it has also made the threat of pandemics even stronger. Thousands of people travel around the world each day spreading their cultures with other but also spreading diseases. Beth from Contagion first got the virus, MEV-1, when she was in Hong Kong, but when she traveled to Chicago and then returned home to Minneapolis spreading the virus to everyone, she encountered including her son. COVID-19 is especially easy due to the delay it takes for the body to show signs of sickness. Someone who has the virus will not even know the have the virus for about a week until the show symptoms allowing them to go out in public infecting everyone they meet.</p>

    <p class="textjustify">Over the centuries, humanity has slowly ravaged the environment all around the world, slowly sucking out resources for our own gain. Now, society is paying the price of our past actions. Habitats are destroyed for the riches they possess, the wildlife that inhibited these habitats either die off and go extinct or wander towards civilization to eat the scraps left behind by humans. What the animals bring with them are the diseases that they carry, spreading them around to other animals, including humans. The cycle began with the bat in Asia, infected the pig on the farm, which then lead to the death of millions in the movie Contagion. The strange and creepy reality is that COVID-19 is believed to have come from bats located in Asia like the scenario given by the director.</p>

    <p class="textspace">During times of global panic, people believe almost anything without any scientific evidence that the claims are even true. The relationship of Forsythia in the movie is analogous to both hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma because none of the treats are even proven to work. The people in the MEV-1 pandemic feared being infected by the disease therefore clinging on to the hope that Forsythia would work and treat MEV-1 even though the CDC did not approve of the treatment. People today in 2020 are feeling the same emotions and fear about COVID-19 and are willing to do anything to survive the virus thus believing in the treatmentâ€™s convalescent plasma and hydroxychloroquine.</p>

    <p class="textheight">Like the MEV-1 virus in the movie Contagion, COVID-19 is very contagious and deadly. Both viruses are airborne making masks a necessity for everyone to wear when out in public. Social distancing was also instated for MEV-1 like how everyone needs to stay six feet apart to be at a safe distance from anyone infected. To continue being healthy, people would stay home and not encounter other friends and family so the risk of either transmitting or catching the virus, MEV-1, would be low. Around early March this year, self-isolation became a rule among the nation to help lower the number of infected people and to this day the rule still stands. </p>
